# KINAKI
An app made to enable users to search for movies and tv shows, as well as their respective trailers and detailed information. 

### Start the app
```
npm install
npm run dev - to start the program
```
I used [TheMovieDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to get the needed data for the movies and series. I used two different endpoints for the mvovies and tv shows, to separate the search query. The response is the searched data with either movies and their corresponding videos and details or tv shows and their corresponding trailers and info.
